# What the Flexbox?

Notes and Observations for [the course](https://flexbox.io/) by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos)

## The Flexible Box Model - AKA Flexbox
The attributes of flexbox are distributed through two main contexts:
1. The flex container
2. The flex items

Everything within the **flex container** now adheres to the flexible box model and all descendants of this
container become **flex items**.

To enable flexbox: `display: flex;`

## Flex container
Considerations:
* flex-direction
* flex wrapping
* etc.

## Flex items
Considerations include:
* order
* etc.
